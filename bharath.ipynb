        "# ***Introduction:-***\n",
        "Statistical analysis is a fundamental aspect of data science and machine learning. By understanding and applying statistical methods in this session, we will explore the basics of statistical analysis using Python, leveraging libraries like pandas, numpy, and scipy.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. ***Descriptive Statistics:***\n",
        "\n",
        "**Mean, Median, Mode:** These give you a sense of the central tendency of each feature in the dataset. For example, the mean of 'MedInc' (median income) will tell you the average income in the dataset, while the median gives you the middle value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Standard Deviation and Variance:** These measure the dispersion or spread of the data. A high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a larger range of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Range:** This shows the difference between the maximum and minimum values for each feature, giving you a sense of the data's spread.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Skewness:** This indicates the asymmetry of the distribution. A skewness close to zero indicates a symmetric distribution, while positive or negative values indicate skewness to the right or left, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Kurtosis:** This measures the \"tailedness\" of the distribution. High kurtosis indicates more outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. *** One-Sample T-Test:***\n",
        "T-Statistic and P-Value: The one-sample t-test compares the mean of the 'MedInc' values against a hypothetical population mean (3.5 in this case). The t-statistic shows how far the sample mean is from the population mean in units of the standard error, and the p-value indicates the probability of observing a result at least as extreme as the one obtained, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:** If the p-value is small (typically less than 0.05), you might reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the sample mean is statistically significantly different from the population mean. If the p-value is large, you do not reject the null hypothesis, meaning there isn't strong evidence to suggest the sample mean is different from the population mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. ***95% Confidence Interval:***\n",
        "Interpretation: The confidence interval provides a range of values that is likely to contain the true population mean of 'MedInc' with 95% confidence. If this interval does not include the hypothetical population mean (3.5), this further supports the conclusion from the t-test that the sample mean is significantly different from the population mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. ***Linear Regression:***\n",
        "Regression Summary: The linear regression model examines the relationship between the independent variable ('MedInc', median income) and the dependent variable ('target', median house value).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Outputs:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Coefficients:** The coefficient for 'MedInc' indicates the expected change in the median house value for a one-unit increase in median income, holding all else constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "**R-squared:** This measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. A higher R-squared indicates a better fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "P-value for the Coefficient: **bold text**If this p-value is low (typically < 0.05), it suggests that the independent variable ('MedInc') is statistically significantly related to the dependent variable ('target').\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion: **If the coefficient for 'MedInc' is positive and statistically significant, you can conclude that higher median incomes are associated with higher median house values. The strength and direction of this relationship are reflected in the coefficient and R-squared value."
